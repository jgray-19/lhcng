lhcng - MAD-NG Utilities
=======================

This package provides tools for creating and managing accelerator models,
extracting optics and RDTs, and running tracking simulations with MAD-NG.
While it targets the LHC by default, the environment variable ``ACCEL`` can be
used to adapt the routines to other machines.
